# DESCRIPTION

**steam-runtime-supervisor** runs *COMMAND* as a child process and waits
for it to exit, with modifications to its execution environment as
determined by the options.

# OPTIONS

**--assign-fd** _TARGET_**=**_SOURCE_
:   Make file descriptor *TARGET* in the *COMMAND* a copy of file
    descriptor *SOURCE* as passed to **steam-runtime-supervisor**,
    similar to writing `TARGET>&SOURCE` as a shell redirection.
    For example, **--assign-fd=1=3** is the same as **1>&3**.
    The redirection is done at the last possible moment, so the output
    of **steam-runtime-supervisor** (if any) will still go to the
    original standard error.

**--close-fds**
:   Do not pass inherited file descriptors to the *COMMAND*,
    except for file descriptors 0, 1 and 2
    (**stdin**, **stdout** and **stderr**)
    and any file descriptors passed to **--pass-fd** or as the target
    of **--assign-fd**.
    **--no-close-fds** disables this behaviour, and is the default.

**--env** _VAR=VALUE_
:   Set environment variable _VAR_ to _VALUE_.
    This is mostly equivalent to using
    **env** _VAR=VALUE_ *COMMAND* *ARGUMENTS...*
    as the command.

**--env-fd** _FD_
:   Parse zero-terminated environment variables from _FD_, and set each
    one as if via **--env**.
    The format of _FD_ is the same as the output of `$(env -0)` or the
    pseudo-file `/proc/PID/environ`.

**--exit-with-parent**
:   Arrange for **steam-runtime-supervisor** to receive **SIGTERM**
    (which it will pass on to *COMMAND*, if possible) when its parent
    process exits.
    **--no-exit-with-parent** disables this behaviour, and is the default.

**--inherit-env** *VAR*
:   Undo the effect of a previous **--env**, **--unset-env**
    or similar, returning to the default behaviour of inheriting *VAR*
    from the execution environment of **steam-runtime-supervisor**
    (unless **--clear-env** was used, in which case this option becomes
    effectively equivalent to **--unset-env**).

**--inherit-env-matching** *WILDCARD*
:   Do the same as for **--inherit-env** for any environment variable
    whose name matches *WILDCARD*.
    If this command is run from a shell, the wildcard will usually need
    to be quoted, for example **--inherit-env-matching="FOO&#x2a;"**.

**--lock-create**
:   Create each **--lock-file** that appears on the command-line after
    this option if it does not exist, until a **--no-lock-create** option
    is seen.
    **--no-lock-create** reverses this behaviour, and is the default.

**--lock-exclusive**
:   Each **--lock-file** that appears on the command-line after
    this option will be locked in **F_WRLCK** mode (an exclusive/write
    lock), until a **--no-lock-exclusive** or **--lock-shared**
    option is seen.
    **--no-lock-exclusive** or **--lock-shared** results
    in use of **F_RDLCK** (a shared/read lock), and is the default.

**--lock-fd** *FD*
:   Receive file descriptor *FD* (specified as a small positive integer)
    from the parent process, and keep it open until
    **steam-runtime-supervisor** exits. This is most useful if *FD*
    is locked with a Linux open file description lock (**F_OFD_SETLK**
    or **F_OFD_SETLKW** from **fcntl**(2)), in which case the lock will
    be held by **steam-runtime-supervisor**.

**--lock-file** *FILENAME*
:   Lock the file *FILENAME* according to the most recently seen
    **--[no-]lock-create**, **--[no-]lock-wait** and **--[no-]-lock-exclusive**
    options, using a Linux open file description lock (**F_OFD_SETLK** or
    **F_OFD_SETLKW** from **fcntl**(2)) if possible, or a POSIX
    process-associated record lock (**F_SETLK** or **F_SETLKW**) on older
    kernels.

    These locks interact in the expected way with **bwrap**(1),
    **flatpak**(1) and other parts of **steam-runtime-tools**.
    It is unspecified whether they exclude the **flock**(2) locks used
    by util-linux **flock**(1) or not, so using those locks on lock
    files used by **steam-runtime-tools** should be avoided.

**--lock-wait**
:   For each **--lock-file** that appears on the command-line after
    this option until a **--no-lock-wait** option is seen, if the file is
    already locked in an incompatible way, **steam-runtime-supervisor**
    will wait for the current holder of the lock to release it.
    With **--no-lock-wait**, which is the default,
    **steam-runtime-supervisor** will exit with status 125
    if a lock cannot be acquired.

**--lock-wait-verbose**
:   Same as **--lock-wait**, but if the lock cannot be acquired immediately,
    log a message before waiting for it and another message after it is
    acquired.

**--pass-fd** *FD*
:   Pass the file descriptor *FD* (specified as a small positive integer)
    from the parent process to the *COMMAND*, even if **--close-fds**
    was specified.
    This option has no practical effect if **--close-fds** was not used.

**--subreaper**
:   If the *COMMAND* starts background processes, arrange for them to
    be reparented to **steam-runtime-supervisor** instead of to **init**
    when their parent process exits, and do not exit until all such
    descendant processes have exited.

**--terminate-idle-timeout** *SECONDS*
:   If a non-negative **--terminate-timeout** is specified, wait this
    many seconds before sending **SIGTERM** to child processes.
    Non-integer decimal values are allowed.
    0 or negative means send **SIGTERM** immediately, which is the
    default.
    This option is ignored if **--terminate-timeout** is not used.

**--terminate-timeout** *SECONDS*
:   If non-negative, terminate background processes after the *COMMAND*
    exits. This implies **--subreaper**.
    Non-integer decimal values are allowed.
    When this option is enabled, after *COMMAND* exits,
    **pressure-vessel-adverb** will wait for up to the time specified
    by **--terminate-idle-timeout**, then send **SIGTERM** to any
    remaining child processes and wait for them to exit gracefully.
    If child processes continue to run after a further time specified
    by this option, send **SIGKILL** to force them to be terminated,
    and continue to send **SIGKILL** until there are no more descendant
    processes. If *SECONDS* is 0, **SIGKILL** is sent immediately.
    A negative number means signals are not sent, which is the default.

**--unset-env** *VAR*
:   Unset *VAR* when running the command.
    This is mostly equivalent to using
    **env -u** *VAR* *COMMAND* *ARGUMENTS...*
    as the command.

**--verbose**
:   Be more verbose. If used twice, debug messages are shown.

# ENVIRONMENT

`PRESSURE_VESSEL_LOG_INFO` (boolean)
:   If set to 1, same as `SRT_LOG=info` or **--verbose**

`PRESSURE_VESSEL_LOG_WITH_TIMESTAMP` (boolean)
:   If set to 1, same as `SRT_LOG=timestamp`

`SRT_LOG`
:   A sequence of tokens separated by colons, spaces or commas
    affecting how output is recorded. See source code for details.

# OUTPUT

The standard output from *COMMAND* is printed on standard output.

The standard error from *COMMAND* is printed on standard error.
Diagnostic messages from **steam-runtime-supervisor** may also be printed
on standard error.

# SIGNALS

If **steam-runtime-supervisor** receives signals **SIGHUP**, **SIGINT**,
**SIGQUIT**, **SIGTERM**, **SIGUSR1** or **SIGUSR2**, it immediately
sends the same signal to *COMMAND*, hopefully causing *COMMAND* to
exit gracefully.

# EXIT STATUS

The exit status is similar to **env**(1):

0
:   The *COMMAND* exited successfully with status 0.

125
:   Invalid arguments were given, or **steam-runtime-supervisor**
    failed to start.

126, 127
:   The *COMMAND* was not found or could not be launched.
    These errors are not currently distinguished.

255
:   The *COMMAND* was launched, but its exit status could not be
    determined. This happens if the wait-status was neither
    normal exit nor termination by a signal.

Any value
:   The *COMMAND* exited unsuccessfully with the status indicated.

128 + *n*
:   The *COMMAND* was killed by signal *n*.
    (This is the same encoding used by **bash**(1), **bwrap**(1) and
    **env**(1).)
