/**
 * SrtFileLockFlags:
 * @SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_CREATE: If the lock file doesn't exist, create it
 * @SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_WAIT: If another process holds an incompatible lock,
 *  wait for it to be released; by default srt_file_lock_new()
 *  raises %G_IO_ERROR_BUSY immediately
 * @SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_EXCLUSIVE: Take an exclusive (write) lock instead
 *  of the default shared (read) lock
 * @SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_REQUIRE_OFD: Require an open file descriptor lock,
 *  which is not released on fork(). By default srt_file_lock_new() tries
 *  an OFD lock first, then falls back to process-oriented locks if the
 *  kernel is older than Linux 3.15.
 * @SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_PROCESS_ORIENTED: Require a process-oriented lock,
 *  which is released on fork(). By default srt_file_lock_new() uses
 *  an OFD lock if available.
 * @SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_VERBOSE: If the lock cannot be acquired immediately,
 *  log a message before waiting for it and another message when it is
 *  acquired. Currently ignored if not also using %SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_WAIT.
 * @SRT_FILE_LOCK_FLAGS_NONE: None of the above
 *
 * Flags affecting how we take a lock on a runtime directory.
