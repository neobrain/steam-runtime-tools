 * SrtSteamIssues:
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_NONE: There are no problems
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_UNKNOWN: A generic internal error occurred while trying
 *  to detect the status of the Steam installation, or, while reading a
 *  report, either an unknown issue flag was encountered or the Steam issues
 *  field was missing
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_CANNOT_FIND: Unable to find the Steam installation,
 *  either via its canonical symlink `~/.steam/root` or various fallback
 *  methods. See srt_system_info_dup_steam_installation_path().
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_DOT_STEAM_STEAM_NOT_SYMLINK: `~/.steam/steam` is not
 *  a symbolic link to Steam data, which for example can happen
 *  if Steam was installed on a system with <https://bugs.debian.org/916303>.
 *  See srt_system_info_dup_steam_data_path().
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_CANNOT_FIND_DATA: Unable to find the Steam data,
 *  either via its canonical symlink `~/.steam/steam` or various fallback
 *  methods. Steam is unlikely to work in this situation.
 *  See srt_system_info_dup_steam_data_path().
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_DOT_STEAM_STEAM_NOT_DIRECTORY: `~/.steam/steam` is
 *  neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
 *  Steam is unlikely to work in this situation.
 *  See srt_system_info_dup_steam_data_path().
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_DOT_STEAM_ROOT_NOT_SYMLINK: `~/.steam/root` is not
 *  a symbolic link to the Steam installation.
 *  See srt_system_info_dup_steam_installation_path().
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_DOT_STEAM_ROOT_NOT_DIRECTORY: `~/.steam/root` is
 *  neither a directory nor a symbolic link to a directory.
 *  Steam is unlikely to work in this situation.
 *  See srt_system_info_dup_steam_installation_path().
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_STEAMSCRIPT_NOT_IN_ENVIRONMENT: The environment
 *  `STEAMSCRIPT` is not set. Probably it's safe to be considered a minor
 *  issue.
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_MISSING_STEAM_URI_HANDLER: There isn't a default desktop
 *  application that can handle `steam:` URIs.
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_UNEXPECTED_STEAM_URI_HANDLER: The default Steam URI
 *  handler executable is either not what we expected or is different from the
 *  one `STEAMSCRIPT` points to.
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_UNEXPECTED_STEAM_DESKTOP_ID: The default Steam desktop
 *  application ID is not what we expected.
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_UNEXPECTED_STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH: If the
 *  environment `STEAM_COMPAT_CLIENT_INSTALL_PATH` is set, its realpath() is
 *  not the equivalent of `~/.steam/root`.
 * @SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_INSTALLED_IN_USR: The Steam installation must be
 *  outside `/usr` for the container runtime to work as intended.
 *  It is normally in the home directory of each user who will run it,
 *  at `~/.local/share/Steam` or`~/.steam/debian-installation`.
 *
 * A bitfield with flags representing problems with the Steam
 * installation, or %SRT_STEAM_ISSUES_NONE (which is numerically zero)
 * if no problems were detected.
 *
 * In general, more bits set means more problems.
