Description:
 libcapsule is a helper library used to implement segregated run-time
 dynamic linking proxy libraries - used (for example) to load a library
 that has dependencies incompatible with the regular libraries that are
 part of the host OS, such as an incompatible libstdc++ version.
 .
 This package contains the files needed to build libcapsule proxy libraries.

Description:
 libcapsule is a helper library used to implement segregated run-time
 dynamic linking proxy libraries - used (for example) to load a library
 that has dependencies incompatible with the regular libraries that are
 part of the host OS, such as an incompatible libstdc++ version.
 .
 This package contains relocatable versions of the tools used to enumerate
 library symbols and dependencies. After building this package on a system
 with the oldest glibc that is to be supported, they can be bundled in
 projects that need to run on an arbitrary host system and make use of
 libcapsule to prepare a container. To do this, the relocatable tools
 must be copied to PATH/bin/TUPLE-capsule-TOOL, and their required
 non-glibc libraries (libelf and zlib) must be copied to PATH/lib/TUPLE.
